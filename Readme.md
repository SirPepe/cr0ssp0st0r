# cr0ssp0st0r

Minimum-effort script for cross-posting from mastodon to bluesky. Expecting that
bluesky will, like all things, be enshittified in the near future, this script
is devoid of any attempts at anything beyond "it barely works".

## Usage

Download, set up environment variables, deploy in some fashion. Be sure to make
the storage directory persistent, otherwise threads won't work right.
